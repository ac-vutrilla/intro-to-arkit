# Let's get st***AR*** ted with ARKit

## Course slides

## About This Workshop
--------
In this course, we'll dive into using and understanding basic concepts of AR and ARKit2.

ARKit2 is a modern and full-featured iOS Framework used to create augmented reality experiences for iPhone and iPad. The applications for this kind of technology are nearly endless. You could point your camera at a painting and have details about the artist appear nearby, or see how furniture would look in your office before buying and moving it. And, of course, AR opens the door to a lot of interesting and fun projects.


## What will we do?

We’ll begin by taking a look at how this fantastic iOS Framework works at a high level. Talk about the recent improvements that have perfected the ability to interact with the "Real World" for a truly Augmented Reality experience.

We’ll build a simple application using Swift and implementing some concepts related to **tracking**, **scene understanding** and **rendering**.

******
## By coding along in this workshop, you will:

* Get hands on experience with 3D models (importing and rendering)
* Unlock extra productivity by consolidating existing 3D models into your own Scene
* Learn a bit about SceneKit
* Learn how to use basic AR Session configurations
* Build your own “Augmented Reality” experience
And more…
